# Overview

This repository serves as a [documentation guide / wiki](<./Documentation/Documentation.md>) for the code / mechanics / implementation details of the game [Relapse](https://github.com/aidenr2023/Relapse).

This wiki is mainly for the developers of the game to use.

- Programmers should be able to use this to understand *how to expand upon or interact with the game's existing features*.
- Designers should be able to use this to understand *how the game's systems work so they can do their work accordingly*.

> ***NOTE***: Anything found in this wiki is subject to change at any time.

### How Do I Use This Wiki?

Click the link at the top of the readme ([or this link](<./Documentation/Documentation.md>)) to go to the documentation home page. That should provide you with a list of links that will eventually take you to where you want to be.

Alternatively, you can open the `Documentation` folder in this repository to see a list of all the `.md` files that make up this wiki.

#### Quickly Looking Through the Wiki

You can ctrl + f the page to look through the text on the page.

You can use the search bar at the top of page that says `Type / to search` to search for a specific word / phrase in the wiki.

#### Why Does the Wiki Look like Code and Not Pretty Text???

Sometimes, instead of the wiki having all the formatting I put ***so*** much time into making, the wiki can look like this:

There is a very simple fix for this. In the top left corner of the text view, click the `Preview` button to switch the text from `Code` view to `Preview` view.
