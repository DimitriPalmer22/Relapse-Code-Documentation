# Contributing to This Wiki

#### What is Markdown?

This wiki was made using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

#### How Does This Wiki Work?

After creating documentation using Markdown, you can push your changes to the [repository](). Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main branch and will be visible to everyone.


#### What Software Do I Need?

You can use any text editor to write Markdown. However, I recommend you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a program that uses Markdown to create a personal knowledge base. It is free to use and has many features that make writing Markdown easier.
