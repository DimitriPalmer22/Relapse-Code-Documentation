#### What is Markdown?

This wiki was made using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. Markdown files are saved with the `.md` file extension.

> In simpler terms, you create a markdown file by making a file that ends with `.md`. Inside these files, you can format your text to turn boring text files into organized notes.

#### How Does This Wiki Work?

After creating documentation using Markdown, you can push your changes to the [repository](https://github.com/DimitriPalmer22/Relapse-Code-Documentation/tree/main). After your changes are pushed, you can view your changes on GitHub.com, which has a nice system for viewing Markdown files within the browser.

> Fun fact, the README.md that you may or may not create when making your own GitHub repository is written in Markdown! By default, GitHub will display a repository's README.md file on the repository's main page. That is what you're seeing right now!

> Also, you can use a little Markdown formatting in Discord! This is how we make the messages that have the large titles and subtitles.

#### What Software Do I Need?

You can use any text editor to write Markdown. However, I recommend you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a program that uses Markdown to create a personal knowledge base. It is free to use and has many features that make writing Markdown easier.

> Make life easy for yourself. Don't use anything other than Obsidian.

Next, you need some way to commit your changes to the GitHub repository. I recommend you use GitHub Desktop for this.

> Make life easy for yourself. Don't use Git Bash for this.
