### Journal System
- There will pickups throughout the level. The player presses the interact button (E) to pick them up.
- These objects will be ambiguous glowing BALLS (just so we don't have to model all the special items)
- When the player interacts with them, an image / drawing of it will pop up w/ a short description of the image
- An entry will be added to the player's journal (that they can see once they pause the game or something)

#### Journal Entry
- Image of the object
- Title of the object
- Longer lore-related description of the object
