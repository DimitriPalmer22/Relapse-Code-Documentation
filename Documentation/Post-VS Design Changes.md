# Art

We are changing the art style.

## Contemporary References

- Any telltale game for shading
- NFS Unbound for (VFX specifically)
- Borderlands for linework and textures

### VFX
- Think NFS Unbound
- 2D graphic novel / comic art
- Think speech bubbles, impact effects, etc.

## New Workflow

***We don't have an actual new workflow rn solidified. But we're planning to have specific people only work on specific things. I.E. 1 person for texturing, 1 for hardsurface modeling***

> [!Important]
> NO MORE HI-POLYS. It makes everything slower for the design team. Also, If you're gonna do a high to low poly, keep the naming convention the same.

## NAMING CONVENTIONS

Make sure the names are consistent

ObjectTypePrefix_AssetName_Iteration

- For example, the first version of a texture called RoofTiles would be named like: *Tex_RoofTiles_01*.
	- The only exception to this would be the bones of a rigged character.


| Object Type     | Prefix |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Texture         | Tex    |
| Low Poly Model  | LowP   |
| High Poly Model | HiP    |
|                 |        |
