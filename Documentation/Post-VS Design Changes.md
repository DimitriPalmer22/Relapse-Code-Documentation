# Art

We are changing the art style.

## Contemporary References

- Any telltale game for shading
- NFS Unbound for (VFX specifically)
- Borderlands for linework and textures

### VFX
- Think NFS Unbound
- 2D graphic novel / comic art
- Think speech bubbles, impact effects, etc.
- For tooltips, we can have the regular tooltips be basic speech bubbles. For the tooltips that relate to objectives, we can have them be the spiky speech bubbles.
	- NOTE: These will be animated. The speech bubbles themselves WILL NOT BE ANIMATED / WE ARE NOT USING VIDEO / GIF FILES FOR THESE.
	- Instead, the bubbles will be separated into 2 different layers for foreground and background. The background will stay stationary, but the foreground PNG will be animated via the Unity animator.

## New ART Workflow

We don't have an actual new workflow solidified right not, but we're planning to have specific people only work on specific things.
	For example, 1 person for texturing, 1 for hard-surface modeling

> [!Important]
> NO MORE HI-POLYS. It makes everything slower for the design team. Also, If you're gonna do a high to low poly, keep the naming convention the same.

### NAMING CONVENTIONS

Make sure the names are consistent

ObjectTypePrefix_AssetName_Iteration

- For example, the first version of a texture called RoofTiles would be named like: *Tex_RoofTiles_01*.
	- The only exception to this would be the bones of a rigged character.

| Object Type     | Prefix |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Texture         | Txtr   |
| Low Poly Model  | LowP   |
| High Poly Model | HigP   |
| Animation       | Anim   |

# Mechanics

## Powers

## Movement

- Revisit how far you can wall-run for.
	- The gravity is too strong right now

# Enemies

# Designers

## New Workflow

Before we even start the favelas, we need to create some sort of test level that reflects how we want the real level to play.
- For instance, if we want a variety of wall-running and dashing
