#### So What *Exactly* Do the Powers Do?

When the player *releases* the power button, the power is activated. When the power is activated, the power's *i*

#### Generally, How Are the Powers Implemented?

Powers in Relapse use a ***2-part system*** as the basis of their implementation:

- Unity's [***Scriptable Objects***](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html), which allow for easy modification of existing powers and the creation of new powers. This is so designers can easily make their own changes to the simple behavior of the powers.
- Unity's [***Prefab System***](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html), which allows for easy and modular implementation of power behavior. Each power has a prefab that contains a script with the logic for the power's behavior.

#### Anatomy of The Power Scriptable Object

| Data Field                       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Power name**                   | The name of the power that gets displayed in-game                                                                                    |
| Power Type                       | Whether the power is drug-based or med-based                                                                                         |
| Icon                             | The UI image for the power that is displayed in-game                                                                                 |
| Description                      | A text box that will be shown to the user so they know what the power does                                                           |
| Charge Duration                  | How long the player has to hold the power button before being able to release the power                                              |
| Active Effect Duration           | **ONLY APPLIES TO SOME POWERS**. If the power has an active effect that lasts, this field represents how long that power is active   |
| Cooldown Duration                | How long before the player is able to use the power again after using it                                                             |
| Base Tolerance Meter Impact      | How much the tolerance meter goes up or down after using the power. Drugs add this value to the tolerance meter, while meds subtract |
| Tolerance Meter Level Multiplier | If the player upgrades the power,                                                                                                    |
