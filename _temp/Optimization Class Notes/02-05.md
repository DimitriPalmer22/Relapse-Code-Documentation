## Optimizing Data Structures

### Reuse Data Structures
- Avoid unnecessarily reallocating new data structures
- Most have "clear" functions to remove prior contents
- Keep around the structure itself

### Avoid Iteration / Enumeration
- The iterator design pattern (enumerators in C#) wraps data structure progression in a lovely interface, at a price (speed)
- Stick with for/while/foreach iteration in hotspots

### Multidimensional Arrays
- Represents a matric and features cohesive memory collection
- But can waste space since every row contains the same number of columns

### Jagged Arrays
