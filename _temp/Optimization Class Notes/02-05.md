## Alternative To Update Manager

## Optimizing Data Structures

### Reuse Data Structures
- Avoid unnecessarily reallocating new data structures
- Most have "clear" functions to remove prior contents
- Keep around the structure itself

### Avoid Iteration / Enumeration
- The iterator design pattern (enumerators in C#) wraps data structure progression in a lovely interface, at a price (speed)
- Stick with for/while/foreach iteration in hotspots

### Multidimensional Arrays
- Represents a matric and features cohesive memory collection
- But can waste space since every row contains the same number of columns

### Jagged Arrays
- Potentially fragmented memory footprint but no wasted space
- Performs appreciably faster than multidimensional arrays in C#
	- The idea is to create all items at once so that memory does not become split
## Optimizing Strings
- Immutable Strings
- C# does have immutable strings
- Avoid using `myString == ""` because it creates a new string
	- Use string.Empty instead
- If you wanna use tags, use Component.CompareTag to avoid a heap allocation

### String Interpolation
- is faster and handier than concatenation

### Enums in C#

### Avoid Slow String Functions
- Avoid regular expressions if not fully necessary
- Avoid slow string functions. You can use StringComparison.Oridinal

## Refactoring for Optimization
- Reducing hidden function calls (Properties)
