# Code Optimizations

### Low-Level / Unmanaged Languages
- C, C++
- Compiles directly to machine code

### High-Level / Managed Languages
- C#. Python, etc.
- Compiles to an intermediate language
	- Native-Managed Bridge
- JIT Compiler
	- Only compile the function as you need it
	- If you never call a function's code, then you never compile its code
	- Once a function has been compiled, keep it in memory for future use
	- Good for platform-indepedence
- Common Language Infrastructure (A platform-dependent layer)
	- .NET Framework for C#
	- Allows for the JIT compiler to work on different platforms
