### GPU & CPU Stuff
- The CPU determines what things are being rendered
- the GPU actually renders the stuff
- Immediate Mode (CPU):
- Retained Mode (GPU):
- Command Buffer
	- If the CPU is underutilized, the command buffer is starved
	- If the GPU is overutilized, the command buffer gets full. The device drives blocks the command buffer from getting more information (at about 3 frames. That's 3 frames of input lag) 
- Graphics APIs: DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan
- Is my game CPU or GPU bound?
	- All games are one or the other
- CPU Bound usual suspects:
	- Physics
	- Particles
	- AI
	- Memory management
- GPU Bound usual suspects
	- Poly count
	- Texture size
	- Shaders
	- lightning
