### GPU & CPU Stuff
- The CPU determines what things are being rendered
- the GPU actually renders the stuff
- Immediate Mode (CPU):
- Retained Mode (GPU):
- Command Buffer
	- If the CPU is underutilized, the command buffer is starved
	- If the GPU is overutilized, the command buffer gets full. The device drives blocks the command buffer from getting more information (at about 3 frames. That's 3 frames of input lag)
- Graphics APIs: DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan

### Is My Game CPU or GPU Bound?
- All games are one or the other
- CPU Bound usual suspects:
	- Physics
	- Particles
	- AI
	- Memory management
- GPU Bound usual suspects
	- Poly count
	- Texture size
	- Shaders
	- lightning
- Detection: Add busy work to the CPU
	- If framerate remains, you are CPU bound
- If we are desperately CPU bound, consider utilizing GPGPU (General Purpose GPU)
- Inversely, we can reduce the GOU workload to see if we are GPU bound
	- In Unreal specifically, we can use r:ScreenPercentage = 10

### PC Building Simulator Lol
- PSU
- Motherboard
- CPU
	- Thermal paste
- GPU
- RAM

### GPU Performance Terms
- Overdraw: Average number of times a pixel is drawn
	- How is this more than 1?
		- Overlapping, antialiasing, alpha blending, lighting, shadows, shaders, etc.
	- Things can be drawn from front to back (but we have to do extra calculations for that)
- Texture Bandwidth / fill: Larger texture cache supports larger texture sizes since we keep around recurring texels
- Fill Rate: how quickly we can draw pixels in MP, millions
	- 400 MP/sec / 60fps = 6.66 MP/frame
	- Say resolution of 1920x1080 = 2.073 MP
	- Then 6.66 MP/frame divided by 2.073 = 3.22
	- We ca only touch a pixel 3 times (or else we bottleneck)
- VRAM (GPU Memory) (Video RAM): workspace for the GPU and holds the frame buffer for displaying final renders
- Nonlocal VRAM - GPU's version of virtual memory to borrow from the main system's RAM (slow)

# Profiling Performance

Introduces lag

### Levels of Intrusiveness
1. Observation: noticeable chugging and hitches
2. Benchmarking: external and superficially light
3. Sampling (in editor at regular intervals)
4. Interception: intermediary collecting traffic, like a packet sniffer
5. Instrumentation: deep code altering for detailed events / timing

### Remove Distractions
- Disable logging (surprisingly expensive) and known exception handling
- Toggle off Vsync: hides extraneous data. waiting for the device framerate (WaitForTargetFPS)
- Remove external distractions like heavy apps in the background
- Runtime tests deceptive when profiled during loading (trigger start or delay benchmark)
