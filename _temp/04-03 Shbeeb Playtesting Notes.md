# 04-03 Shbeeb Playtesting Notes

### General Notes

- Scale audio logarithmically

- Screen shake for pistol is a lil crazy. needs to be scaled down a little
	- Disorienting at close quarters 
- Framerate in movement1: bake lights
- Combat in combat1 after the warehouse took WAYYY too long
- Fix the shader thats around the arenas
- FIX the respawn points
- Death bug
- Make sure there are invisible walls

- Less visibility in the distance for the cities
- For UI, the bright thing should be the one thats highlighted
- Make the tutorials better by making them seem more like a real space.
- Get proper framerate and lighting before we can rly get solid feedback on combat. 
- Buff the mine

- Fix the spawners
- Change the name of the "elevator keycards"
### Movement2

- We still need to chate the direction of the wall climbs. No winding around the corner
- Z fighting on one of the roofs
- The transition to the cinematic is a bit abrupt. If it's gonna be immediate, at least make the camera transition.

### Aiden Mindbreak

- Move the trigger colliders back so the player can complete the level in rhythm

### Movement3

- We could have a flashing light for some things to draw attention to where the 

- The space isnt engaging enough rn
- Add some interactable elements
- Our game has multiple mechanics and stuff, we can play into that a little more in the combat areas so that its not just run and shoot
- Elevation utility
