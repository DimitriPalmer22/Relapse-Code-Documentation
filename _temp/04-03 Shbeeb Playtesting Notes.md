# 04-03 Shbeeb Playtesting Notes

### General Notes

- Scale audio logarithmically

- Screen shake for pistol is a lil crazy. needs to be scaled down a little
	- Disorienting at close quarters 
- Bad framerate in combat1, floor2: solution -> bake lights
- Fix the shader that's around the arenas. You can still see it even when the walls aren't up
- Death bug (might be tied to the satellite dishes possibly not being configured correctly)
- Make sure there are invisible walls for parts of the level where you don't want the player to go / climb

- There should be less visibility in the distance for the cities
- For UI, the bright thing should be the element that's highlighted
- Make the tutorials better by making them seem more like a real space. Maybe add buildings in the background or something
- We need to get proper framerate, lighting, enemy placement, and enemy behavior before we can rly get solid feedback on combat. 
- Buff the explosive mine power

### Combat1
- Remove static enemies inside the warehouse. It's confusing to have 12 enemies in front of you a
- Combat after the warehouse took WAYYY too long
- Change the spawners to use the wave spawner instead of continuous
- Change the name of the "elevator keycards"
- fix the respawn points (the ones for when you fall off the level)
### Movement2

- We still need to chate the direction of the wall climbs. No winding around the corner
- Z fighting on one of the roofs
- The transition to the cinematic is a bit abrupt. If it's gonna be immediate, at least make the camera transition.

### Aiden Mindbreak

- Move the trigger colliders back so the player can complete the level in rhythm

### Movement3

- We could have a flashing light for some things to draw attention to where the 

- The space isnt engaging enough rn
- Add some interactable elements
- Our game has multiple mechanics and stuff, we can play into that a little more in the combat areas so that its not just run and shoot
- Elevation utility
