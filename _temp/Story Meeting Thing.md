### Meeting Notes

#### Art
- The artists decided that they need to regularly communicate with each other. The biggest problem we've been having is that nobody really has a clear understanding of what the game should look like or what the other assets look like.
- Everyone in the call artists decided that NEED to meet with each other regularly. This is non-negotiable. These meetings will be for discussing the current state of the art style and for art asset updates.
	- The first meeting (and what should ideally be as soon as possible) should be to decide the texturing workflow/creation of props and who or how they should be textured. We don't want all of the texturing responsibilities to be placed on 1 person
- New Art Style: Realistic models & painted textures.
