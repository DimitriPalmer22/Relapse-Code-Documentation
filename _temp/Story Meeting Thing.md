### Meeting Notes

@everyone

#### Art
- The artists decided that they need to regularly communicate with each other. The biggest problem we've been having is that nobody really has a clear understanding of what the game should look like or what the other assets look like.
- Everyone in the call artists decided that NEED to meet with each other regularly. This is non-negotiable. These meetings will be for discussing the current state of the art style and for art asset updates.
	- The first meeting (and what should ideally be as soon as possible) should be to decide the texturing workflow/creation of props and who or how they should be textured. We don't want all of the texturing responsibilities to be placed on 1 person.
- Artists should also take note of how the designers (specifically Mikel) make videos / charts and documentation for how they want things to be done.
	- They do this so the rest of the designers know what to do and can keep the game looking consistent.
	- Artists should do the same for texturing and modeling. This way, the other artists have a resource to look back on.
- New Art Style: Realistic models & painted textures.

#### Narrative
- The problem we are having is that Shbeeb thinks the messaging we have in the game is inconsistent with the game's mechanics.
- This is because they don't know what the fuck the message is.
	- The message is *NOT* "Drugs are bad"
	- The drugs in the game are more so representations of any bad things that people can get addicted to.
- Andre is cooking something up that will serve as the basis for the narrative.
- Gianfranco is going to Shbeeb during the office hours on Wednesday to clarify what he wants to see from the narrative.
