### C# Research: Inhertiance, Interfaces, Abstraction

***GOAL***: The purpose of this is to get you even more familiar with using inheritance in C# since most scripts in the project use inheritance.

> Goal of Research: If a parent class or interface is not making sense, try to look at the classes that extend from it to see how it is properly implemented.

### C# Inheritance Personal Project

***GOAL***: The purpose of this is to build more confidence when working with inheritance / composition on your own.

#### Project Prompt: "Animal Care System"

1. **Inheritance**:

	- Create an abstract class `Animal` with properties like `Name` (string) and `Age` (int), and an abstract method `MakeSound()` that returns a `string` (this string is unique to each type of animal)
	- Create two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal`. Each should implement `MakeSound()`, returning a unique sound (e.g., "Woof" for `Dog` and "Meow" for `Cat`).
2. **Composition**:

	- Define an interface `ICare` with methods `Feed()` (returns `string`) and `Play()` (returns `bool`).
	- Implement `ICare` in two classes, `DogCare` and `CatCare`. `Feed()` should return a message like "Dog has been fed" or "Cat has been fed," and `Play()` should return `true` if the animal is happy to play (could be based on random logic or age).
3. **Objective**:

	- Develop a console app where users can create animals, feed, and play with them. This should reinforce knowledge of inheritance and composition with clear return types.
	- The description for this personal project is intentionally a little loose because you are meant to play with it. Try to explore and discover things so you get more comfortable.

### C# Research: Events

***GOAL***: Get much more comfortable using events in C#. These are the basis for the collaborative system I have set up so that you can interact with my scripts and their logic without having to edit the scripts themselves.
