### Playtest the Game
- Same playtest notes as usual

Set up a tab system for the settings menu

- From now on, you will need edit the settings menu in the scene called "PauseUIScene" to edit the pause menu. Changes made here will be reflected in the rest of the game
- Each button in the header of the settings menu should have its own separate page in the settings menu.
- Don't worry about having controller compatibility for this portion of the menu yet. It's buggy and I'm working on a fix for it.
- The current sliders for controller / mouse sensitivity should be moved to the "Controls" tab of the settings menu. Also, it should be noted that these sliders are placeholders that will eventually be replaced. Maybe don't use these as one-to-one references for the other tasks.
- The rest of the tabs do not need to be populated yet. They are placeholders for future settings that will be added to the game.

Setting for Brightness in the menu

- This setting will be a simple slider that controls the brightness setting in the game.
- 

Settings for Audio settings in the menu

- This task will most likely take you the most time out of all your tasks for this week.
