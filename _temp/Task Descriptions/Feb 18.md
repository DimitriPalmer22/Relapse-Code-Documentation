# Weapon Balancing

In Relapse, the player will (eventually) have the ability to purchase newer, more powerful versions of the guns in the vendor areas. We need the weapons that the player can buy to be more balanced.

### How to Change the Gun Values

The guns are composed of two main parts:

- The scriptable object that contains the gun's stats
- The gun prefab

You will be editing the guns' scriptable objects to balance the weapons. The scriptable objects for the guns are located in `/Assets/Scriptable Objects/Gun_SO`.

DO NOT REBALANCE THESE GUNS. THEY WILL NOT BE USED!:

- Shotgun 1
- Shotgun 2
- Shotgun 3
- Hand Cannon
