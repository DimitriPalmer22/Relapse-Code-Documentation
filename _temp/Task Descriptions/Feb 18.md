# Weapon Balancing

In Relapse, the player will (eventually) have the ability to purchase newer, more powerful versions of the guns in the vendor areas. We need the weapons that the player can buy to be more balanced.

Every weapon has a base version (the name of it ends with 1) that is the weakest version of the weapon. The other versions of the weapon are stronger and more expensive (the number at the end of the weapon's name increases with the weapon's power).

### How to Change the Gun Values

The guns are composed of two main parts:

- The scriptable object that contains the gun's stats
- The gun prefab

You will be editing the guns' scriptable objects to balance the weapons. The scriptable objects for the guns are located in `/Assets/Scriptable Objects/Gun_SO`.

DO NOT REBALANCE THESE GUNS. THEY WILL NOT BE USED!:

- Shotgun 1
- Shotgun 2
- Shotgun 3
- Hand Cannon

### Balancing Tips

#### Pistol

The pistol is supposed to be the most reliable weapon in the game. Do not think of the pistol as the weakest weapon in the game. It should be strong enough that it is a viable option for the player to use.

The pistol focuses on accuracy, long range, and decent damage over a long distance. The pistol's limiting factor is it's semi-automatic firing mode and its lower rate of fire.
