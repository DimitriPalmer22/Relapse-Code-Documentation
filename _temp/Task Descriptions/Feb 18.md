# Weapon Balancing

The guns are composed of two main parts:

- The scriptable object that contains the gun's stats
- The gun prefab

You will be editing the guns' scriptable objects to balance the weapons. The scriptable objects for the guns are located in `/Assets/Scriptable Objects/Gun_SO`.

In Relapse, the player will (eventually) have the ability to purchase new guns in the shop

DO NOT REBALANCE THE "Shotgun" Weapons, those are not going to be used
