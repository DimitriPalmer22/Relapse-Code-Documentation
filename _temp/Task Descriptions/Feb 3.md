### Create Debugging Tools to Help with Playtesting

To aid with playtesting, debugging, and showcasing the game, we need some tools to control the current state of the game. This includes the ability to:
	- Teleport the player to specific locations
	- Change the player's health
	- Change the player's inventory

### Playtest
- Same playtest notes as normal
### Font Curation

Since we are getting closer to the end of the project, we are starting to replace the placeholder assets with more finalized versions. This includes the fonts we use for the game. We need to find a font that fits the game's aesthetic and is easy to read.

Don't replace the fonts for the UI elements in the game yet, as they might still be getting worked on. Instead, make a scene that shows off the several fonts you are considering and get feedback from the team.

### Tutorial Video Creation
The scriptable objects for the tutorials can be found in the 'Asse'
