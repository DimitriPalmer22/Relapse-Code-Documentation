### Create Debugging Tools to Help with Playtesting

To aid with playtesting, debugging, and showcasing the game, we need some tools to control the current state of the game. This includes the ability to:
	- Teleport the player to specific locations
	- Change the player's health
	- Change the player's inventory

### Playtest
- Same playtest notes as normal
### Font Curation

Since we are getting closer to the end of the project, we are starting to replace the placeholder assets with more finalized versions. This includes the fonts we use for the game. We need to find a font that fits the game's aesthetic and is easy to read.

Don't replace the fonts for the UI elements in the game yet, as they might still be getting worked on. Instead, make a scene that shows off the several fonts you are considering and get feedback from the team.

### Tutorial Video Creation

Right now, the tutorials in the game are still using placeholder videos. This needs to change. We need to start getting iterations of the tutorial videos in the game so we can start getting some feedback on them.

The scriptable objects for the tutorials can be found in the 'Assest/Scriptable Objects/Tutorials_SO'.

The way the tutorials work, you can have a different video for each page of the tutorial OR a single video for the entire tutorial. To change the video for a page of the tutorial, change the "video clip" field for the tutorial page you want to change in the "Tutorial Pages" section of the tutorial scriptable object.

Do this for each of the tutorial scriptable objects you see in the folder.

DO NOT IMMEDIATELY PUSH THE VIDEOS INTO THE PROJECT'S REPOSITORY. Video files are pretty large and the GitHub repository is limited on space. Instead, send them through the discord or upload them to the OneDrive and ask for feedback first. Then, once they get approved, they can be added to the project.
