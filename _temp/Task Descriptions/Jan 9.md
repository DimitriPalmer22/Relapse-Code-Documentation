- Sound curation is going to be your focus for this week. The game is going to be given more life via sound.
1. Revisit the power sounds entirely
	- Having a one-shot sounds for charging the power is not gonna work. We don't think the sound for this right now fits.
	- Instead, we will have a looping sound effect when the player is charging their power.
		- This way, the player can charge their power for an indefinite amount of time and the sound effect will loop.
		- This sound effect NEEDS to be uninvasive and subtle so that player won't get annoyed any time they charge a power.
	- Then, once the player releases the power, we will have a one-shot sound effect for that.
	- We also need a different sound for when a power is done cooling down. We don't think the sound for this right now fits.
2. Also, we need to replace the placeholder sounds for:
	- shooting
	- reloading
	- player getting hit
	- enemies getting hit
3. Also, we need some more sounds for the enemies to give them life
	- Idle groaning / breathing sounds
	- A sound for when the enemy is alerted of the player's presence. Like a grunt.
	- A swipe / wind sound effect for when the enemy attacks
	- A grunt for when the enemy attacks

> The code does not exist yet for some of these. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THESE SOUNDS. Just find them / ask your sound person to create them. From there, we will look at the sounds you've gathered and determine if they fit the game's aesthetic.

Also, the menus in our game don't really feel good when trying to navigate using buttons (on a controller or even a keyboard)

- In an empty scene, create a simple menu system that feels good to navigate with a keyboard AND controller.
- The menu should look like the following:
