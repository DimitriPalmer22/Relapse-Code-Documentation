# Revise Power Tutorial Text

Okay, so after feedback from the CD, the tutorial text needs to go in a different direction. The text needed to be a little more instructional and 

- Use [POWER NAME] to [POWER ACTION] that [WHAT IT DOES TO THE ENEMIES / THE PLAYER].
- The UI in Unity recognizes *some* HTML tags, so BOLD and ITALICIZE the names of the power.
	- Surround the name of the power like `<b><i>`[POWER NAME]`</b></i>`
-
