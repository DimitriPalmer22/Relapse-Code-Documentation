# BAKING

Use the "Low res lighting test settings". pls don't change the settings. If you want to change the lighting settings, clone the settings and edit those.

Turn off any big ass planes before baking. These planes mess up bake times & bake a lot of unnecessary info.

If you want, you can try to bake with the background buildings turned on. However, if this is takes too long, you can turn them off.
