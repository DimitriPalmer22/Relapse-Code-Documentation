- Right now, the game does not focus on combat as much as we hoped it would.
- Ideally, the game should encourage the player to use the guns and ESPECIALLY their powers
- The movement systems + level designs distract the player from the killing enemies / just allows them to run away
- HOPEFULLY, getting complete enemies would fix this by itself
	- Crawlers should be small & fast, but easy to kill
	- The enforcers should be ranged and should pester the player from a distance.
	- The Lesion should be a slower, hard-hitting melee enemy that is able to take some damage
	- The fat nigga blows up or runs at the player

#### Andre
- Go in, kill waves of fodder enemies
- Then, for the final wave of enemies, have some type of indication that this is the final wave
- Then, have some type of punctuation to the wave so that it doesn't seem like the combat is just ending
	- Like an enemy dropping something
	- Think of something that connects the combat section to the next section of the game.
		- Remember, the combat is supposed to stop them from progressing until they finish it
- While killing the fodder, the player should be using powers
- For that final "wave" / boss wave, the player should be thinking "which enemies should I take out first so that this is easier for me as a player".
	- Should not be mindlessly shooting enemies.
	- Should be an overwhelming force that requires them to adjust their style of play or else they will frustratingly keep dying

#### Mikel
- The player should have some level of understanding of the goal / objective they are trying to reach
- It should be clear that the enemy / enemies are the reason they cannot progress.
- Therefore, the player is motivated to kill the enemies

#### Combined Thoughts
- Waves should progressively become more difficult.
	- IDEA for harder waves
		- 1st wave has only crawlers
		- 2nd wave adds a lesion surrounded by crawlers
		- 3rd have some big guys
		- 4th wave has everything
	- The "Elite" enemy *could* just be the drunkard as opposed to placing them within the existing waves.
		- Idea: the attack changes based on his health. He attacks by spitting blood out of his neck, and he progressively.
- The waves need some type of concluding element to let the player know they're done.
- The player should have a clear understanding of what objective the enemies are preventing them from obtaining.
- Synergy between different enemy types should encourage the player to use the powers and to critically think of how to kill the enemies.
- *Some* areas are gonna have placed enemies.
-
- Wave-based areas should be areas the player cannot progress past without completing. Areas w/ placed enemies only serve to slow the player down slightly.
