- Right now, the game does not focus on combat as much as we hoped it would.
- Ideally, the game should encourage the player to use the guns and ESPECIALLY their powers
- The movement systems + level designs distract the player from the killing enemies / just allows them to run away
- HOPEFULLY, getting complete enemies
