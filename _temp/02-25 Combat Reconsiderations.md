- Right now, the game does not focus on combat as much as we hoped it would.
- Ideally, the game should encourage the player to use the guns and ESPECIALLY their powers
- The movement systems + level designs distract the player from the killing enemies / just allows them to run away
- HOPEFULLY, getting complete enemies would fix this by itself
	- Crawlers should be small & fast, but easy to kill
	- The enforcers should be ranged and should pester the player from a distance.
	- The Lesion should be a slower, hard-hitting melee enemy that is able to take some damage
	- The fat nigga blows up or runs at the player
