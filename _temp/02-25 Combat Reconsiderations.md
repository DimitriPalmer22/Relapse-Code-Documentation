- Right now, the game does not focus on combat as much as we hoped it would.
- Ideally, the game should encourage the player to use the guns and ESPECIALLY their powers
- The movement systems + level designs distract the player from the killing enemies / just allows them to run away
- HOPEFULLY, getting complete enemies would fix this by itself
	- Crawlers should be small & fast, but easy to kill
	- The enforcers should be ranged and should pester the player from a distance.
	- The Lesion should be a slower, hard-hitting melee enemy that is able to take some damage
	- The fat nigga blows up or runs at the player

#### Andre
- Go in, kill waves of fodder enemies
- Then, for the final wave of enemies, have some type of indication that this is the final wave
- Then, have some type of punctuation to the wave so that it doesn't seem like the combat is just ending
	- Like an enemy dropping something
	- Think of something that connects the combat section to the next section of the game.
		- Remember, the combat is supposed to stop them from progressing until they finish it
- While killing the fodder, the player should be using powers
- For that final "wave" / boss wave, the player should be thinking "which enemies should I take out first so that this is easier for me as a player".
	- Should not be mindlessly shooting enemies.
	- Should be an overwhelming force that requires them to adjust their style of play or else they will frustratingly keep dying

#### Mikel
- The player should have some level of understanding of the goal / objective they are trying to reach
- It should be clear that the enemy / enemies are the reason they cannot progress.
- Therefore, the player is motivated to kill the enemies

# Combat Revision

Combat in the game needs to be refined more.

### Waves
- For areas with waves, the waves should progressively become more difficult.
- An EXAMPLE of how harder waves *could* work:
	- 1st wave has only crawlers
	- 2nd wave adds a lesion surrounded by crawlers
	- 3rd has some enforcers
	- 4th wave has an "elite" enemy
- The "Elite" enemy *could* just be the drunkard as opposed to placing them within the existing waves. I repeat, the drunkard is not going to be within the standard waves.
	- The attack changes based on his health. He attacks by spitting blood out of his neck. As he takes damage his attack types change. So, he can charge toward the player and explode.
	- The visual indication that he is getting weaker is more blood spurting. The indication that he is about to blow tf up is a big ass spurt of blood (more intense that the other one).
- ***The waves need some type of concluding element to let the player know they're done***.
- The player should have a clear understanding of what objective the enemies are preventing them from obtaining.
- Synergy between different enemy types should encourage the player to use the powers and to critically think of how to kill the enemies.
- *Some* areas are gonna have placed enemies.
- Wave-based areas should be areas the player cannot progress past without completing. Areas w/ placed enemies only serve to slow the player down slightly.
- For the crawler, INSTEAD of having two different types of crawlers (one melee one ranged), the crawler will be a 2-in-1 (melee and ranged).
	- The crawler will randomly choose to be in melee or ranged mode every couple of seconds.
	- The tail being up or down will be the visual indication to the player of the crawler's mode

### Boss Fight
- The boss fight is fighting NEEGA-Kin
- The boss should be enforcer-size
- *IDEA*: The boss can ONLY have up to 4 neuros. Based on the number of neuros the player picks up, the boss gets that number of neuros.
	- PRESET POWERS:
		- Fireball
			- Make it home in on the player a lil bit
		- Chain lighting
			- Telegraph when / where the lightning is gonna hit
			- Stuns the player (does a lil damage cuz the player is still gonna be shooting)
		- Explosion
			- NEEDS to be very obviously telegraphed
			- Push the player back.
			- "Get off me" type shit
			- Should do 35% of damage
		- Virus
			- Should behave the same way as the normal virus
			- The initial hit should do 10% and the damage over time should do 15%
	- When determining which powers to give the boss, the game will prioritize the powers the player has. Then, the game will fill in the rest with the preset powers.

### It's All in Your Head
- We need to better convey that the player is tripping out
- Use the same jittery material that is on the billboards but put it more throughout the rest of the game
- We need some type of consistent visual motif for anything that SHOULD NOT exist in that space.
- Alex's slide is good, but how is it gonna look with finalized assets?
	- *Idea*: use one of the sloped buildings for it?
	- *Idea*: use some type of blackout around the hole
