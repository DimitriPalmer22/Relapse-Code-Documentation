#### Explosive Mine

**Overview**:

The player fires a 'mine' from their hand that sticks to any surface it hits (including walls, but excluding enemies). Once the mine has stuck to a surface, it will stay there. Once an enemy comes within a certain range of the mine, the mine's fuse starts. The fuse lasts for a second, and then the mine explodes, damaging any enemies within the blast radius.

#### Spreadblast

**Overview**:

The player fires a couple pellets from their hand that spread out as they travel. The pellets damage any enemies they make contact with. Think of this as like a shotgun blast. Pellets that don't hit enemies and instead hit the ground / a wall leave behind a fiery residue that damages enemies that walk over it.

#### Virus

**Overview**:

The player fires out a projectile that explodes, but the explosion doesn't do any immediate damage. Instead, it "infects" any enemies that are in range. Infected enemies take damage over time.
