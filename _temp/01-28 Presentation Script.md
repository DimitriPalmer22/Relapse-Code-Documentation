### Take a Pause Rq to Talk about Conveyance
- Whenever we presented the game or showed it to game testers / showed people the game, WE found a big problem we had was that they had a hard time understanding what was going on.
- Even now, we're still trying to nail that.
	- Where am I at?
	- Where do I go?
	- Why does this happen?
	- What's the difference between this and that?
	- How would I know to do this?
- So, a big focus for development was the theme of conveyance; how do we let the player what they NEED to know THROUGH the GAME?
- So, if at any point you feel like a part of the game is confusing, or needs more visual / auditory feedback, its helpful to let us know.

### Resume into the Level. Introduce the Art Style Changes
