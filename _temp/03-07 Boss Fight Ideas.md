# Extra Abilities
One thing I'm worried about is the boss not being very 

- The boss ALSO has 3 power up abilities equipped (Like overdrive)
- Based on the phase the boss is currently in, the enemy gains an outline material (with its own unique color)
- At the start of the boss fight, they're all disabled.
- At the start of each phase (after the initial phase), a new power-up ability is "unlocked"
	- Every couple of seconds, the boss will choose one of the "unlocked" abilities and temporarily turn it on
