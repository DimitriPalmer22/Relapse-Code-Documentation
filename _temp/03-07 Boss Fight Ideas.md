# Firearm
The boss is gonna use the standard pistol. However,

# Neuro / Vital Powers

I need a centralized way to easily add boss logic to EACH power.

Boss Power SO

- Corresponding Player Power
- Charging
	- Move while charging
	- 

# Extra Abilities

One thing I'm worried about is the boss not being very engaging if the player chooses not to take any Neuros. So, I propose an extra system to keep the fight interesting.

- The boss ALSO has 3 power up abilities equipped (Like overdrive)
- Based on the phase the boss is currently in, the enemy gains an extra ability.
- Each ability is also indicated by an outline material (with its own unique color)
- At the start of the boss fight, they're all disabled.
- At the start of each phase (after the initial phase), a new power-up ability is "unlocked"
	- Every couple of seconds, the boss will choose one of the "unlocked" abilities and temporarily turn it on
