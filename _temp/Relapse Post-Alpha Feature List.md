List of features we want to add to Relapse post-alpha:

- New gamemode: an endless wave mode where the player endlessly fights through waves of enemies. At the end of every couple of waves, the shop opens up, allowing the player to buy new weapons and get new powers. This should be done by April 6th.
- New gamemode: A simple speedrunning course with a timer that tracks how long the player took to complete their current run of the course. This should be done by April 13th.
- New Art Assets:
	- New textures (to make the art style more cohesive)
	- Graffiti & decals (to decorate the environment)
	- Small props (to set-dress the environments more)
