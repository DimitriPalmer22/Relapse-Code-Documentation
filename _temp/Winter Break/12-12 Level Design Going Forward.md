This document summarizes what is in this video and applies it to our own game.

The overall idea of this document is that your game's gameplay should dictate how levels are designed.

# Gameplay Gardens

Instead of making each level completely from scratch, we can make use of "***Gameplay Gardens***".

These are free spaces where you place different obstacles & objects that let you test and fine-tune your mechanics / bits of gameplay.

> Think of these as test scenes / levels where you can test out the movement, powers, enemies, etc.

So basically:

- Gameplay gardens should be made FIRST so that we can get a solid understanding of how we want the game to play
- Then we will implement the ideas from our gameplay gardens into the actual game.

Once you want to actually make a level, you just stitch a few of these gameplay gardens together.

# Nonlinear Level Design

When making a level, having it be so linear makes the level deadass boring. Giving the players MEANINGFUL options in how to approach your game makes it fun.
