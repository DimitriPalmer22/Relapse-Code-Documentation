The overall idea of this document is that your game's gameplay should dictate how levels are designed.

# Gameplay Gardens

Instead of making each level completely from scratch, we can make use of "***Gameplay Gardens***".

These are free spaces where you place different obstacles & objects that let you test and fine-tune your mechanics / bits of gameplay.

> Think of these as test scenes / levels where you can test out the movement, powers, enemies, etc.

So basically:

- Gameplay gardens should be made FIRST so that we can get a solid understanding of how we want the game to play
- Then we will implement the ideas from our gameplay gardens into the actual game.
