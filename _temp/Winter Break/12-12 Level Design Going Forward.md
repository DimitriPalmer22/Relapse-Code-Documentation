This document summarizes what is in this video and applies it to our own game.

The overall idea of this document is that your game's gameplay should dictate how levels are designed.

# Gameplay Gardens

Instead of making each level completely from scratch, we can make use of "***Gameplay Gardens***".

These are free spaces where you place different obstacles & objects that let you test and fine-tune your mechanics / bits of gameplay.

> Think of these as test scenes / levels where you can test out the movement, powers, enemies, etc.

So basically:

- Gameplay gardens should be made FIRST so that we can get a solid understanding of how we want the game to play
- Then we will implement the ideas from our gameplay gardens into the actual game.

Once you want to actually make a level, you just stitch a few of these gameplay gardens together.

# Nonlinear Level Design

When making a level, having it be so linear makes the level deadass boring. Giving the players MEANINGFUL options in how to approach your game makes it fun.

Maybe make use of keys and locked doors to explore some nonlinear levels?

- BE CAREFUL WITH THIS.
- This can lead to problems where the player can possibly miss understanding a certain mechanic if they take one path vs another.
- The player can also get lost if there is no obvious indication of progression.

# Levels as Teachers

Through the game's level design, the player learns about the game's mechanics.

Whenever you have a mechanic / feature present in one of the levels, you, as a level designer, have to think about the game as a WHOLE.

- Did the player learn about this mechanic / feature beforehand?
- If not, am I properly teaching them about it right now?
- For how skilled I expect the player to be at this point in the game, are there too many features / mechanics being used at once right now?
- Am I teaching the player too many mechanics / features in this part of the game / level?
- Is the way I'm teaching the player about this mechanic / feature confusing???

### Concept Graph

When making a level, it is important to keep track of all the information / mechanics / features the player needs to know in order to complete the level.

"***Concepts***" can range from being able to interact with items to using powers to traverse the environment better.

Some ***concepts*** are dependent on other concepts.

Making a concept graph makes it very easy to visualize which concepts still need to be taught to the player.
