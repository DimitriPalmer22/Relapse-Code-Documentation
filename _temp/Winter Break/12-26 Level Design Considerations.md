## Things to Standardize

For gameplay to remain consistent across the whole level, a couple things need to be solidified.

### Architecture
- Floor height across all buildings.
	- The lesion enemies are approximately 4 Unity Units tall, so each floor of each building needs to be *AT LEAST* this tall.

### Movement System Sections
- Jump Lengths.
	- If the player is supposed to jump across a specific section of the level, having that size be consistent is a good way for the player to realize they are supposed to jump over something.
- Wall-runnable surfaces
