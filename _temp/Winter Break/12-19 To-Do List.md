###### Keeping Player Information between States
- [ ] Store the player's information into a more serializable format (have a class or a struct or something for each important component of the player)
- [ ] Whenever a scene is loaded, have a script check to see if an instance of this data exists. If so, apply it to the player. Otherwise, keep the player's data as is.
- [ ] When the player wants to SAVE the game, this script gets serialized
