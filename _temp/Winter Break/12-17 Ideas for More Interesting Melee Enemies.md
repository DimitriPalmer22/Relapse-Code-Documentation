# Ideas for More Interesting Melee Enemies

Right now, the melee enemies are kinda boring to fight and they're still not that much of a threat. They just chase the player around until the player guns them down.

I looked up ways to make melee enemies more interesting for FPS games and came across [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/a0ch72/how_should_fps_games_approach_melee_enemies/). One of the main themes is that more maneuverability is good for melee enemies.

Here are some ideas I got:

- Some enemies can have an overdrive mode where they temporarily run WAY faster than usual and close the distance between them and the player
- Some enemies can have a teleport ability than unpredictably moves them closer to the player / behind the player somewhere.
- Some enemies have a dodge / counterattack ability where when they are shot at, they have a chance to "dodge" that attack. If the enemy dodges the bullet, they negate the damage from that shot and dash toward the player. (They shouldn't directly forward into the player. They should dash a little off to the side so that the player needs to adjust their aim to hit them again)
- Some enemies explode when they are killed next to the player. (this explosion can damage other enemies too).
- Some enemies can pull the player toward them.

Things like these would make crowds of enemies much more dangerous. Since that is the case, we would have more room for crowd control powers / abilities for the player to use.

Think of powers like

- AOE knockback
- AOE stun
- AOE slow
- AOE damage
- Make the enemies think that one of the enemies is a player so they attack them instead.
- etc.
