# Slightly Better Melee Enemies

Enemies are more of a threat now.

- Enemies will consistently keep track of the player now. No more spinning around or instantly losing the player
- Increased movement speed
	- They *could* be even faster if you turn up their speed in the nav mesh agent
- Animation Events for when EXACTLY to enable / disable each hand's hitbox during the different attack animations
- Animation Events for when EXACTLY to enable / disable movement during the different attack animations
- If you are within a certain range of the enemies, you get detected no matter what. This range has been increased.
