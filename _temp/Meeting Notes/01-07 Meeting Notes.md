# 01-07 Meeting Notes

@everyone REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT.
Also, read the whole announcement, even it doesn't apply to you. We need everyone to understand what's going on.

Notes from the meeting we had after class on 01-07:

## General Stuff
- Sprints are 2 weeks long, Monday - Sunday
- Halfway through each sprint, everyone's lead(s) will check in on them. This is to catch problems before they happen / determine if we need to reduce the game's scope.
- The gameplay / aesthetic of the level we showed in VS **DOES NOT** fully represent how we want the game to be. The game from this point on will be much faster paced.

## The Gauntlet / The UI
- The game will NO LONGER have a completely diegetic UI through the gauntlet on the player's left hand.
- The entire idea / design of the "device" on the player's left hand is changing.
- Alex & Azalee are concepting new looks for it.
	- *HOWEVER*, we still need to determine how exactly we want the "device" to be animated while the player is using a power.
- We will have a more traditional minimal UI.
- Any diegetic elements on the "device" will supplement the traditional UI.

### Why Are We Getting Rid of the Gauntlet???
- If you look at almost any FPS game, the player's hands are directly in front of the screen. This is because this is the most natural position to hold a gun in. However, in our game, we would need to pose the hands awkwardly no matter what in order to show off any UI on the player's left hand.
- If the player's left hand gets animated at any point, the diegetic UI on the arm becomes infinitely harder to read. Also, any pose / animation we do for the hands has to account for the player seeing the UI.
- There's too much information we want to convey to the player for it all to fit on the gauntlet. Instead of completely reworking the UI, it'd be easier to just make a more traditional UI.

## The Hands
- The hands will be repositioned to hold the player's weapon more conventionally.
- Any time the player uses a power, the left hand will be animated to move away from the gun.

## Art Style
- We are leaning heavily into the more comic book aesthetic for the game.
- To do this, we are implementing 2D effects / animations in a lot of places to spice up the game visually.
- Also, we are working on using lines in the textures of models to create this effect.

## Animations
- The animations for the enemies that are currently in the game need to be reworked.
- Andre will be in touch to describe how the animations should be done.

## Level Design
- From now on, the game's levels need to properly account for the game's mechanics.
- To do this, we are splitting the next level into 2 different sets of sections: Movement sections and Combat Sections.
- This way, we can more concretely focus on how we want the player to play the game in specific environments.
- Once we get the 2nd level down, then we can revisit the look and feel of the first level.

## Problems with the Game

Our biggest problem is conveyance: when people play our game, they often have no idea wtf is going on.

- Players had a hard time understanding what exactly the powers did.
- Players couldn't really differentiate between drug-based powers and med-based powers.
	- On top of that, players didn't really understand the repercussions of using the drug-based powers over the med-based powers.

### How to Fix Them

- Unique particle effects for the different powers in the game. This way, the player can easily tell what power they just used. This also plays into the whole aesthetic of the player tripping balls.
- Better tutorials. Whenever the player encounters a new mechanic, the game pauses and a tutorial screen pops up with a video + text description of how to use the new thing.
	- The player can access these tutorials from the pause menu.
- To differentiate the drugs from the meds, we'll have different icons for both. The drugs can have a skull icon & the meds powers could have a green cross.
