# 01-07 Meeting Notes

@everyone PLEASE REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT.

Here are some notes from the meeting we had after Shbeeb ended class early on 01-07:

## General Stuff
- Sprints are going to be Monday - Sunday
- The gameplay / aesthetic of the level we showed in Vertial Slice DOES NOT fully represent how we want the game to be. The game from this point on will be much faster paced. 

## The Gauntlet / The UI
- The game will NO LONGER have a completely diegetic UI through the gauntlet on the player's left hand.
- In fact, the entire idea / design of the "device" on the player's left hand.
- Alex & Azalee are in charge of concepting new looks for it.
- From now on, we will have a more traditional minimal UI.
- Any diegetic UI that is a part of the "device" on the player's left hand will purely be there to supplement the traditional UI.
