# 01-07 Meeting Notes

@everyone PLEASE REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT.

Here are some notes from the meeting we had after Shbeeb ended class early on 01-07:

## General Stuff
- Sprints are going to be Monday - Sunday
- The gameplay / aesthetic of the level we showed in Verti 

## The Gauntlet
- The game will NO LONGER have a completely diegetic UI through the gauntlet on the player's left hand.
- In fact, the entire idea / design of the "device" on the player's left hand
