- New outline shader. The game looks cleaner compared to the old ones
- Selection Shader
- I also fixed the posterization and halftone shader so that they stay consistent no matter how high the player turns up the brightness

# James
- Retweaking the enforcer anims from last week
- Arm no longer teleports in the running animation
- Shooting animation
	- He wasnt sure about the head, but andre will make it head track
- Idle
	- The feet are still sliding, so maybe keep 1 foot still or something
- Heavy Attack Animation thing
	- Might be a little too fast
		- Maybe there should be a buildup that leads into the animation
		- We also need some time for the player to react
	- How to not make it not look "goofy as fuck" (his words not mine)
	- Maintain that hunched over pose
