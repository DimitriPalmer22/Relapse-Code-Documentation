- Game too long
- We STILL need to add more combat
- The apartments need to be condensed somehow

- Brian's movement needs to be shortened
	- It may be a good idea to end the level after breaking the glass

MIKEL IDEA: FOR THE VOID SCENE IN BRIAN'S LEVEL

- Orb has 3 positions.
- INSTEAD of just going through the void, the orb leads you through the different floors of the apartments.
	- The orb leads you on where to go, BUT you can turn around and explore the apartments if you want.
- Also, we're playing this scene BEFORE the boss fight btw.
