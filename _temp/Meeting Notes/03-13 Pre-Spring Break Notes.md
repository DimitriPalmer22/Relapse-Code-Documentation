- Game too long
- We STILL need to add more combat
- The apartments need to be condensed somehow

- Brian's movement needs to be shortened
	- It may be a good idea to end the level after breaking the glass

# Boss Fight
- The boss fight is too dense & has too much going on with it

### No Court Room Arena
- Having a section where the player fights in the courtroom feels a little busy
- The courtroom can be used for a cutscene

### MIKEL IDEA: FOR THE VOID SCENE IN BRIAN'S LEVEL
- Orb has 3 positions.
- INSTEAD of just going through the void, the orb leads you through the different floors of the apartments.
	- The orb leads you on where to go, BUT you can turn around and explore the apartments if you want.
- Also, we're playing this scene BEFORE the boss fight btw.
- This works cuz the orb is the boss
- This is an actual intro to the boss

# Combat
- Enforcer has 100 health so he is the basis for all the enemies
- Lesion is slightly healthier
- Drunkard has the most health.
- Crawler has the least.

- Enemies will become more difficult in each level.

- How do we convey that the player is in a space where they can't continue without killing all enemies?
	- Leo's dissolve shader. It'll fade in as you enter the space and fade out as you leave / clear it.
	- Also, some type of visual motif to signal the area

- Hoard mode.
- Special game mode where the player fights waves of enemies.
- Keep going forever.
- We'll use this

# Motifs for Mindbreak Areas
- Post processing change
- Background ambience in the areas
- Mindbreak splotches as decals or something
- Dissolve shader for enemy wave spaces

# Journal

Get rid of the journal as-is

- Converting the pause menu into the journal
- Objectives are not present in the rest of the level and are lowkey not needed
- Inventory - Just showed in the main menu
- Powers - Just show in the main menu
- Memories are too high-scope, so we no longer need them hoes
- Show the numeric value for health and toxicity values in the pause menu AND the upgrade menu for the vendors

# VFX
- Spawn VFX for enemies so that they don't just pop in
	- Mindbreak VFX effect
- We need grayscale versions of Alex's VFX animations so we can spam them everywhere
- Use the exclamation point as a VFX so that points of interests are easier to see

# Sound
- We NEED sound effects for everything in the game
- The new enemies need new sounds
- The enemy groan gotta go
- The animations NEED sounds to go along with them
- Footsteps
	- Floor
	- Wall running
	- Etc
- Slide
