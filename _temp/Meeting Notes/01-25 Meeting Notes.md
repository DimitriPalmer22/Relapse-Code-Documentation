NEW IDEA FOR THE APARTMENT
- Instead of having the apartment be 1 big continuous section of ass gameplay, we'll split it up throughout the whole game
- For example, we can have an apartment section -> a mindbreak section or something -> a movement section -> a combat section
- This way, the gameplay of the city level doesn't seem extremely foreign once the player reaches there.
- Also, we are moving all 4 vendors in the game to the floors of the apartment level
