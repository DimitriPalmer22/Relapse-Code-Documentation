- Address the goals for the first month. Our sprint objectives are going to be based on this:
	- Completely figure out EXACTLY how we want the game to play. Right now, with the gameplay gardens we have, we have an IDEA of what we want, but it still doesn't represent exactly how we want the game to play in terms of pace and feel.
	- Finish the enemies (models, animations, AI, features)
- Play the game in front of the rest of the group
- Re-affirm what the problems with the game are (especially for the people who didn't read the announcement) (Just go over the announcement we made)
- Briefly go over the playtesting notes from yesterday.
	- We can go over the fixes for the problems and take suggestions from the other designers.
- Articulate:
	- Designers: the overall design for the next level, as well as how their levels are gonna connect.
	- Artists: what the game needs to look like and the work that everyone is responsible for / how their work is gonna contribute to the look of the game

## Design Changes
- The "Favelas" are no longer Favelas.
- Gauntlet changes
	- Remove the gauntlet as it is
	- Change it to something more minimal
	- We now have on-screen UI. We are going for a more traditional on-screen UI
- We are changing the name of the "drugs" and "meds".
	- From now on, the "drugs" will be called "Neural-chemicals" AKA "Neuros". "Meds" will be called "Vital-chemicals" AKA "Vitals". This is because the term "drugs" is too familiar to players and blah blah blah.
- Doctors and Dealers
	- Re-state how they already work:
		- Each doctor and dealer offers a selection of Neuros and Vitals. However, Doctors offer MORE choices for Vitals, while dealers offer MORE choices for Neuros.
		- At each vendor, the player can get 1 Neuro / Vital FOR FREE per vendor. After that, the player can no longer get a Neuro / Vital from that vendor.
- New Design Changes:
	- Players can INCREASE their max health at doctors.
	- Players can INCREASE their max toxicity meter at dealers.
	- Dealer rooms will also contain a selection of FUCKING GUNS the player can buy if they choose not to upgrade their toxicity meter.
- Toxicity Meter and Relapsing overhaul
	- Y'know how we have it so we *Relapse* 3 times and immediately die? Yeah fuck that we're not doing that anymore.
	- Instead, we will allow the player to *RELAPSE* infinitely many times per level. There will be more immediate consequences for Relapsing like slowing the player, making them unable to shoot, etc.
	- This way, we don't punish the players for committing to a certain playstyle through gameplay.
- We have stamina in the game now.
	- We INTEND for it to only be in the combat areas, but for right now, it's everywhere.

## Looking forward
- Right now we have 10 powers: 4 Neuros & 6 Vitals. We need at least 2 more neuros so we have 6 of each. Any ideas?????
- We need to know which powers will be available during which sections. This way, we can know how to design the sections around them.
- Also, we need to know how many combat + movement sections we'll have in level 2, as well as the order of these sections

## Other Level Design Stuff for Level 2 to Consider
- As the game plays right now, we *can't completely* base the game's combat around Ghostrunner. Their enemies die too quick compared to ours. Also, we have fucking guns.
- So, we should not design the levels around moving while shooting. We can SUPPORT that playstyle if the player is good enough, but we should expect the player to be springing while shooting at most.
