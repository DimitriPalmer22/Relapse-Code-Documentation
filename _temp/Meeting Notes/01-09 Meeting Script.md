- Play the game in front of the rest of the group
- Re-affirm what the problems with the game are (especially for the people who didn't read the announcement)
- Go over the playtesting notes from yesterday
- Articulate:
	- Designers: the overall design for the next level, as well as how their levels are gonna connect.
	- Artists: what the game needs to look like and the work that everyone is responsible for / how their work is gonna contribute to the look of the game
- Design Changes:
	- Gauntlet changes
		- Remove the gauntlet as it is
		- Change it to something more minimal
		- We now have on-screen UI. We are going for a more traditional on-screen UI
	- We are changing the name of the "drugs" and "meds".
		- From now on, the "drugs" will be called "Neural-chemicals" AKA "Neuros". "Meds" will be called "Vital-chemicals" AKA "Vitals". This is because the term "drugs" is too familiar to players and blah blah blah.
	- Doctors and Dealers
		- Re-state how they already work:
			- Each doctor and dealer offers a selection of Neuros and Vitals. However, Doctors offer MORE choices for Vitals, while dealers offer MORE choices for Neuros.
			- At each vendor, the player can get 1 Neuro / Vital FOR FREE per vendor. After that, the player can no longer get a Neuro / Vital from that vendor.
		- New Design Changes:
			- Players can INCREASE their max health at doctors.
			- Players can INCREASE their max toxicity meter at dealers.
			- Dealer rooms will also contain a selection of FUCKING GUNS the player can buy if they choose not to upgrade their toxicity meter.
	- Toxicity Meter and Relapsing overhaul
		- Y'know how we have it so we *Relapse* 3 times and immediately die? Yeah fuck that we're not doing that anymore.
		- Instead, we will allow the player to *RELAPSE* infinitely many times per level. There will be more immediate consequences for Relapsing like slowing the player, making them unable to shoot, etc.
		- This way, we don't punish the players for committing to a certain playstyle through gameplay.
