		- We now have on-screen UI. We are going for a more traditional on-screen UI
	- We are changing the name of the "drugs" and "meds".
		- From now on, the "drugs" will be called "Neural-chemicals" AKA "Neuros". "Meds" will be called "Vital-chemicals" AKA "Vitals". This is because the term "drugs" is too familiar to players and blah blah blah. 
	- Doctors and Dealers
