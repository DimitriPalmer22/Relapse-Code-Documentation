- Play the game in front of the rest of the group
- Re-affirm what the problems with the game are (especially for the people who didn't read the announcement)
- Go over the playtesting notes from yesterday
- Articulate:
	- Designers: the overall design for the next level, as well as how their levels are gonna connect.
	- Artists: what the game needs to look like and the work that everyone is responsible for / how their work is gonna contribute to the look of the game
- Design Changes:
	- Gauntlet changes
		- Remove the gauntlet as it is
		- Change it to something more minimal
		- We now have on-screen UI. We are going for a more traditional on-screen UI
	- We are changing the name of the "drugs" and "meds".
		- From now on, the "drugs" will be called "Neural-chemicals" AKA "Neuros". "Meds" will be called "Vital-chemicals" AKA "Vitals". This is because the term "drugs" is too familiar to players and blah blah blah. 
	- Doctors and Dealers
		- Re-state how they already work: 
			- Each doctor and dealer offers a selection of Neuros and Vitals. However, Doctors offer MORE choices for Vitals, while dealers offer MORE choices for Neuros.
			- At each vendor, the player can get 1 Neuro / Vital FOR FREE per vendor. After that, the player can no longer get a Neuro / Vital from that vendor.
