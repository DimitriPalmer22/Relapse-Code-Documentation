### 01-30 WTCS Playtest Notes
- I like the beginning cutscene. I wanna see what it looks like when it's fully done 
- You should probably remove the key delay for the WASD minigame. Some ***absolute gamers*** are too good, which makes them get stuck after pressing the keys too fast.
- Sometimes the speaking audio goes on for longer than the text does
- For that one quest where you have to collect the bags from the Southwest gate, it would be a little more helpful to say that the bags are next to the dining hall rather than the gate.
- Find some way to highlight items that are current quest objectives. (idk put a custom shader on them when the quest is active, or put a world-space UI element over them)
- Right now, the journal only scrolls when you first hover over the scrollbar and then use the scroll wheel. Our game has the same issue and idk how to solve it yet
- There should be some type of death animation or some other way to convey that the player just died
- When Chance is thinking, find a way to articulate that he's thinking instead of just removing his character sprite. Maybe italicize the text too? You could even have a unique set of character images specifically for his thoughts.
- Load zones lol
