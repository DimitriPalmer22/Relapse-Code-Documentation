- I like the new palette you added to the beginning area cuz it forces the player to go to the gun room.
- Also, nice job fixing the fact that the enemy couldn't reach the gun room area cuz he was too fat
- The couches in the 4th floor right next to the gun room (in the pic below) should probably be pushed all the way back to the palette. If the player aggros the enemy and goes behind the couches before getting the gun, then they get trapped because the enemy will never de-aggro and the player has no way to kill it.

- I like the fact that you repositioned the phone so its a lot harder to miss now.
	- Side note: one of us has to make the collider for the phone bigger at some point cuz it feels a little hard to interact with sometimes.
- We should probably turn off the lights in all the bathrooms unless there is something significant in there. I'm tired of mfs playing our game and going straight to the shitter.
- When the player leaves the phone room, they enter the lobby from the angle pictured below. I like the fact that the props initially obstruct the alternate paths from the player's view. However, I do think there needs to also be a MUCH stronger of the correct path that can be seen from this view. Maybe you can place an exit sign on the floor around the pink circle

- The boxes on the 4th floor in the pic below need to be made a little smaller. The lesion enemy there gets stuck on the boxes and can't chase the player beyond that point

- At the end of the long hallway with the lesion (pictured below), there's really nothing of note here for the player to do after they've killed the monster, so it feels a little like wasted space. What we could do is block it off by putting a blocker at the end of the hallway OR

- There is a random invisible collider in the red circle in the pic below. I think its from a leftover trash can or something

- In the tunnels that lead between the rooms (not the tunnel that eventually leads the exit. I mean the bigger set of tunnels that connects to 4 rooms), one of the rooms the tunnels leads to is completely empty (pictured below). We should figure out something to put in this room.
