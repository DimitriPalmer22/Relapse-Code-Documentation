- I like the new palette you added to the beginning area cuz it forces the player to go to the gun room.
- Also, nice job fixing the fact that the enemy couldn't reach the gun room area cuz he was too fat
- The couches in the 4th floor right next to the gun room (in the pic below) should probably be pushed all the way back to the palette. If the player aggros the enemy and goes behind the couches before getting the gun, then they get trapped because the enemy will never de-aggro and the player has no way to kill it.
