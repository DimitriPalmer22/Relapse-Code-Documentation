### General Notes
- Run past enemies that are not in the combat areas

# WHAT TO DO BECUASE GAME IS BROKEN
- **Movement 2**: For the area where the dome comes up (right before the crane), MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH MOMENTUM. The dome will lock you out if you aren't moving fast enough.
- *Floor 2*: DO NOT TALK TO THE VENDOR. YOU WILL GET STUCK AND WILL HAVE TO ALT+F4
