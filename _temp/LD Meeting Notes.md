### How Does the Player Know where to Go
- Use lighting & PP volumes n stuff
- Turn off lights in the rooms the player doesn't need to go into (maybe have some light so its not in complete darkness)
- Floor maps
- Floor level indicators
- Room number indicators
- Windows in the outer rooms
	- Add a skybox
- Have the phones ringing when we get close to them so that they bring the player to that direction
- Dim hallways and stuff that the player shouldn't really be going to

#### Navigation Line Idea

> [!NOTE] WIP
> This is still WIP. We don't even know if we're adding this

- Dead Space line
- Use camera stacking to implement it

##### How Do We Communicate This line to the Player?
- Blood trail
- Footsteps
