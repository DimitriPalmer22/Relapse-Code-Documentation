### How does the player know where to go
- Use lighting
- Turn off lights in the rooms the player doesn't need to go into (maybe have some light so its not in complete darkness)
- Floor maps
- Floor level indicators
- Room number indicators
- Windows in the outer rooms
	- Add a skybox
- Have the phones ringing when we get close to them so that they bring the player to that direction
