### How Does the Player Know where to Go
- Use lighting & PP volumes n stuff
- Turn off lights in the rooms the player doesn't need to go into (maybe have some light so its not in complete darkness)
- Floor maps next to elevators / stairs
	- We *could* add a map to the pause menu (Resident Evil)
	- We *could* also make the map an in-game item (Silent Hill)
- Floor level indicators
- Room number indicators
- Windows in the outer rooms
	- Add a skybox
- Have the phones ringing when we get close to them so that they bring the player to that direction
- Dim hallways and stuff that the player shouldn't really be going to
- Use architecture to guide the player
- Use a PP volume for safe rooms to make them seem safer

#### Navigation Line Idea

***This is still WIP. We don't even know if we're adding this. But, if we did, it would be something likeâ€¦***

*Think of the navigation line in Dead Space*

Use camera stacking to implement it

##### How Do We Communicate This line to the Player?
- Blood trail
- Footsteps

### More Shbeeb Criticisms
- Scale down some of the props.
- He said "we have to think about how the items got in that space"
	- Like the couch not fitting through the door
- The placement of props need to be more intentional
	- We have to communicate the story of the scene more clearly. How do we tell the player that the people moved out in a panic
- More props in the rooms
	- Lights
	- Ceiling things
	- Dedicated airflow
	- Outlets
	- TV (this doesn't need to be in EVERY room)
- More stuff in bathrooms
	- Sink
	- Toilet paper holder
	- Drain or something
	- Shower head
- Trims for the floorboards
- Is there a draw priority or something in Unity that makes important items render first? This will make it so that important objects have less artifacts on them.
- Shbeeb said some the furniture we see in the hallway should also be found in the rooms
- Trash cans at every intersection of the hallways
- He says the hotel room configurations need to be a little more consistent. Probably have 1-3 variants of the rooms since its a hotel(?)
	- In terms of the objects in the rooms, where props are in relation to each other should remain consistent between rooms. For example, if a bed has a dresser to the right of it in one room, then it should have a dresser to the right of it in all rooms.
- Fire escape type shit
