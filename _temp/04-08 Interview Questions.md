#### **Motivation**

> These questions should speak to your understanding of the goals of both you and your potential employer, the opportunities of this job, and the broader context of all of that within the industry. 

- Why are you applying?
- Why do you want to work for us?
I see this job as an opportunity to work with an innovative team while both growing personally and professionally in a field I'm passionate about.

- Why this kind of work?
- How did you hear about us? 

#### **Expectation/Presumption**

> These questions are operating under the expectation that you will take the job if offered OR that you are presuming they will offer the job because they asked for an interview. The key to these is to understand you BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement) and your personal goals both professionally and personally.  

- How much money are you expecting to make in this position?
I'm interested in discussing the full range of benefits and opportunities this role offers. In addition to the base salary, I value professional growth, work-life balance, and performance incentives. Could you maybe share a bit more information your benefits package and how your company supports its team members' growth. This will help me understand the overall value proposition of the position.

- Are you able or willing to work remote?
Yes, I am completely willing to work remote and have done so before for other projects. However, I do have a preference for hybrid and in-person work environments. Ultimately, I'm open to whatever is best for the team and the project.

- What do you think this job looks like on a day-to-day basis? 
- Do you have any questions for us? 
- Why should we hire you? 
I believe you should hire me because I br

#### **Qualifications**

> In these type of questions you want to make sure that you maintain your humility to show that you are teachable, but also recognize that they aren’t hiring a resume, but a person. That means that you should focus on integrating your character and HUMAN (not professional) experience into the value that you represent. 

- What makes you especially qualified for this job? 
- Can you describe what you believe to be a standard content creation pipeline? 
- What steps are you taking to improve upon your weak areas? 
- What is X? 
- Rate your proficiency with X…
- Describe how you troubleshoot your work…
- What are your specializations? 

#### **Self-Awareness**

> These answers are more risk than reward. A bad answer will sink you, but a good answer only floats you to the next. A robot answer reflects poorly on your ability to be reflective and your interest in growing as a person. Keep the answers framed with _contextualized_ truth and how that relates to your work (i.e. how to be managed best given the reality of you). 

- What are # of your strengths? 
- What are # of your weaknesses? 
- Where do you want to be in X amount of time? 
- What kind of manager do you work best with? 
- How well do you work with a team? 
- What will you bring to the team? 
- Which of your skills are you most confident in, and which are you wanting to improve as you work with us? 

#### **Reflection**

> These answers can be telling about how revealing and critical you can be of your former projects. Describing a bad situation in a way that doesn’t throw any one person under the bus can show that you aren’t looking to blame people. Describing the realities of harsh work environments in light of your personal ideals (without judgement) can frame your objectivity, rather than your reactivity. 

- Describe a situation in which you were creating something you weren't passionate about. 
- What is the most important thing that your boss should know about you in order to help you be most effective in this job? 
- How do you feel about working under pressure? 
- Can you explain a time when you had to adapt to changes in a project? How did you handle the situation and what was the outcome? 
- What is your ideal working environment? 

#### **Disclosure**

> These can be “getting to know you” questions or a deeper slice into your personality. Disclose enough to be human, but not enough to be exposed to undue scrutiny. Like your resume and portfolio, don’t give them a reason to ask questions with unflattering answers. 

- What are your interests outside of work? 
- What games do you play for fun? 
- What do you enjoy doing in your free time? 
- Tell me about yourself… 
- What inspired you to become a game programmer/designer/artist? 

#### **Red Flags**

> On their own, these can be innocuous, but the nature of asking them at an interview stage could be them setting you up to get used in your position in a way that you might rather not. Make your best assertions here based on your need of employment and your principled view of a good work/life balance. 

- Can you work overtime/weekends? 
- How do you feel about crunch? 
- How many hours a week are you willing to commit to the project? 
- How often do you expect to be promoted or given a raise? 

#### **Class Originated Questions**

- What was the last book you read? (Or other questions that you may not want to answer directly about personal hobbies/activities)
- How do you think your values align with the company values? (research and forethought)
- Elevator Pitch yourself… (being self-aware)
- How would you handle being given an unrealistic request for work? (interpersonal conflict resolution and communication prompting)
- What games inspire you as a developer?
- What strategies do you use to stay current with industry trends and tech?
