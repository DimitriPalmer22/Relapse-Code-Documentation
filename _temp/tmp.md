### Uhh Notes
- Fix the level design
- In terms of the art style, we need to make sure the art lead & the rest of the leadership are on the same page for what looks good or bad in terms of the art style.
	- We loved the monsters and stuff Mia made, but Franco didn't think it fit the art style. He wanted more support from us for that.
- We need consistent naming conventions for the sake of organization
-

### Workflow Has Been Established
- Alex (Concept Art) -> Check 1 (Leadership) -> 3D Artists (low - mid - high - UV) -> Check 2 -> Rylan (Texture) -> Check 3 -> Designer
- Up to Rylan: we can we UV for him, or he UVs and textures
	- He will be the texture artist for consistency's sake

### Do away with the threads
- Instead of individual threads
