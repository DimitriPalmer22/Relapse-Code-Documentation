### Uhh Notes
- Fix the level design
- In terms of the art style, we need to make sure the art lead & the rest of the leadership are on the same page for what looks good or bad in terms of the art style.
	- We loved the monsters and stuff Mia made, but Franco didn't think it fit the art style. He wanted more support from us for that.
- We need consistent naming conventions for the sake of organization

Workflow has been established
