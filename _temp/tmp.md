### Uhh Notes
- Fix the level design
- In terms of the art style, we need to make sure the art lead & the rest of the leadership are on the same page for what looks good or bad in terms of the art style.
	- We loved the monsters and stuff Mia made, but Franco didn't think it fit the art style. He wanted more support from us for that.
- We need consistent naming conventions for the sake of organization
-

### Workflow has been established
- 3D artists make 3D models: high - low - mid
- Alex (Concept) -> 3D Artists -> Rylan (UV / Tex) -> Designer
- Up to Rylan: we can we UV for him, or he UVs and textures
	- He will be the texture artist for consistency's sake
