# Some Notes I Took during the Meeting

- All of the choices we make for the game NEED to be informed by the game's original concept / vision.
	- Andre says he wants less people to have voices in what goes into the game. "Too many cooks in the kitchen" type shit
### Other Notes
- In terms of the art style, we need to make sure the art leads & the rest of the leadership are on the same page for what looks good or bad in terms of the art style.
- We need consistent naming conventions for the sake of organization

### Workflow Has Been Established
- Alex (Concept Art) -> Check 1 (Leadership) -> 3D Artists (low - mid - high - UV) -> Check 2 -> Rylan (Texture) -> Check 3 -> Designer
- Up to Rylan: we can we UV for him, or he UVs and textures
	- He will be the texture artist for consistency's sake

### Do away with the Threads
- Instead of individual threads, we have threads for groups of people working on a specific feature / level.
	- For example, we have a thread for UI, a thread for monsters + monster animations.

### Camera Locks for Small Cutscenes so that the Player Does not Miss Something
- We need to make sure the player is looking at the right thing at the right time
