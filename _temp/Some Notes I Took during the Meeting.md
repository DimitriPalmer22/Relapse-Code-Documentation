# Some Notes I Took during the Meeting

### Creative Direction
- All of the choices we make for the game NEED to be informed by the game's original concept / vision.
- Less people should have voices in what goes into the game. Right now we have "Too many cooks in the kitchen" type shit
- We need to say "no" to more of the content & ideas that go into the game.
	- Not enough things were fleshed out / reworked / fixed before being put into the game.

### Art Stuff
- In terms of the art style, we need to make sure the art leads & the rest of the leadership are on the same page for what looks good or bad in terms of the art style.
- We need consistent naming conventions for the sake of organization

### Art Workflow
- Alex (Concept Art) -> Check-in 1 -> 3D Artists (low - mid - high - UV) -> Check-in 2 -> Rylan (Texture) -> Check-in 3 -> Designers
	- Depending on how Rylan feels, the other artists can UV for him, or he can do both UVs and textures
- These check-ins are to make sure the asset *fits with the game's creative vision* & is *game-ready*

### Communication: Get Rid of the Threads
- Instead of individual threads, we should have threads for groups of people working on a specific feature / level.
	- For example, we can have a thread for UI. Alex, Robert, and Brian could be in there.
	- This could help communication between group members / departments

### Convey Info to Player: Make the Camera Lock onto Something We want Them to See
- We need to make sure the player is looking at the right thing at the right time so they know what to do type shit
