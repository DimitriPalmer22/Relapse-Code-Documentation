- Billboards too big, so it results in too much time in the player running on the walls. 
	- We want the speedrunning mode to have a little more skill expression from the player, so having *shorter* sections where the player is just running is optimal.
- As of right now, dashing into walls feels and looks a little awkward, so we should move away from that being mandatory to get past a certain section.
	- Dashing over open gaps is cool tho.
- Reduce the time overall where the player spends running with their boots on the ground. 
- The barrel idea is cool, but doing it while running uphill is not challenging and slows down the player too much. 
	- You can keep the barrels idea, but you should implement it in a different way where the player has to use the movement mechanics to get past it (making the player slide or wall run while dodging the barrels would make it feel more engaging)
