- Billboards too big, so it results in too much time in the player running on the walls.
	- We want the speedrunning mode to have a little more skill expression from the player, so having *shorter* sections where the player is just running is optimal.
	- The pacing of wall-running portions here should feel similar to the wall running at the end of Mikel's Movement1.
		- Ideally, we want to increase the number of inputs the player is doing per second just so this area feels a little more engaging.
	- Also, the big billboards looks unnatural. The default billboard size should be fine

- As of right now, dashing into walls feels and looks a little awkward, so we should move away from that being mandatory to get past a certain section.
	- Dashing over open gaps is cool tho.

- Reduce the time overall where the player spends running with their boots on the ground.

- The barrel idea is cool, but doing it while running uphill is not challenging and slows down the player too much.
	- You can keep the barrels idea, but you should implement it in a different way where the player has to use the movement mechanics to get past it
	- making the player slide or wall run while dodging the barrels would make it feel more engaging
	- 

- The sliding section (at about 0:22) seems awkward because the slide mechanic doesn't have enough control to facilitate the way you implemented sliding in your level.
	- Sliding overall is fine, but really steep slides probably are not the move. These are near-vertical, so these would be considered too steep.
	- Slopes that are intentionally placed should be used to boost the player's speed, but they shouldn't be too steep or too long (they also shouldn't be too shallow).
	- If we're using the slopes to intentionally boost the player's speed, then there should be a jump immediately following it that requires the boost in speed.

- One thing we noticed was that (we think) at 0:50 there was a platform that was angled upward. So, when you slid while landing on the platform, the player's momentum died more than we wanted it to.
	- Try not to have platforms angled upward on sections where you are trying to preserve the player's momentum.

- Sliding under the beams felt repetitive. It felt like the same slide every time.
	- To break up the repetitive feeling, incorporate the sliding with other mechanics.
	- idk a wall-run or something going into the slide could feel cool. Wall-run -> slide -> wall-run again
