### Tutorial Mindbreak
- Beginning mindbreak is bright asf. Bright enough for him to go into the settings and turn the brightness down. 
- The place where the enemies are in the mindbreak is dark asf
  

Floor4

- Get rid of the journal tutorial as is
- Jumpscare ![ðŸ˜­](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f62d/32.png)
- We still gotta block off the alternate path or sum
- Idk if he was missing the glowing door or what but the Rickster was going the wrong way
- Tutorialize the volumetric lighting

  

Wall running mindbreak

- Use a separate material for the mindbreaky bricks ngl

  

Movement1

- Lighting
- The back n forth section at the end is a little hard.Â 
- Move the first platform forward (after thr billboards)

  

Combat

- We need to make the drone movement more consistentÂ 
- Billboards need to use the billboard prefab
- Move the trigger for the level transition up

  

Floor5

- The janitor's shoes lol
- DialogueÂ 

  

Wall climbing mindhreak

- All black

  

Movement2

- We need ACTUAL lighting. Its lowkey fucking ip Brians level cuz its too hard to see where to go
- The billboard is confusing cuz it lowkey faces one way
- Slide zones are too low
- Change the model of the big enemy
- Some of the spaces you use for wall climbing are too tight. Also, its a little awkward to be running forward and then turn left to wall climb.

  

Combat 2

- Replqfe the projectile lesions w/ enforcers
- That section w/ the wall running w/ billboards and then the wall climbing is a lil hard
- The player can just run away from the combat area
- Scale the doors cuz they may be a lil small

  

Floor3

- Fix the colliders
- Block off more sections of the level
- Maybe add the transition at the end of the elevator path

  

Shootable object mindbreak

- Shootable object tutorial needed
- Replace the billboard asset
- Replace the barrels here
- Make sure the shootable objects use the shootable object material so they know what to do for the next sectionÂ 

  

Movement 3

- Pacing on billboard still needs work
- The immediate drop caught the player off guard
- More range for the gun so the player can shoot the barrels
- Lowkey the slope at the end doesnt need to be a slope
- Also, having the planks highlighted here is mispesring

  

- Segment the ammo counter
- Colliders for enforcer are wonky
- Power tutorials ![ðŸ˜­](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f62d/32.png)
- He lowkey missed the volumetric lightingÂ 
- Something I noticed is that he killed ALL the enemies instead of running past them
- Make the wall climbing more forgiving in termd it
- Also, i need a way to keep thr player crouched if theyre still under a crouch area
- Jit lowkey got the good ending ![ðŸ˜­](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f62d/32.png)
