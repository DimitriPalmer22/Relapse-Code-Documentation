# What UI Does Our Game Need Right Now?

![](<../_META/Attachments/Pasted image 20250316150025.png>)

Right now, we have 3 bars that need to be redone:

- Health bar (Top middle)
- Stamina bar (Below the health bar)
- Toxicity meter (Bottom left)

As far as I know, our in-game UI is still supposed to be somewhat minimal.

In fact, not 

### The Health Bar

### The Stamina Bar

### The Toxicity Meter

Try to watch the video in the highest resolution possible because YouTube's compression makes it really hard to see the halftones on some parts of the UI.

### The Health Bar

Try not to replicate the overall shape / angle / placement of the health bar. Instead, focus on the details.

- Their health bar is too jagged
- The angle is tilted upward, which we don't really want for our game (at least I don't think we do)

If you zoom in on the health bar, you can see very subtle dots used to create a halftone effect.
