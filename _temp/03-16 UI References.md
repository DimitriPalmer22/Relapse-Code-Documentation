Try to watch the video in the highest resolution possible because YouTube's compression makes it really hard to see the halftones on some parts of the UI.

### The Health Bar

Try not to replicate the overall shape / angle / placement of the health bar. Instead, focus on the details.
- Their health bar is too jagged
- The angle is tilted upward, which we don't really want for our game (at least I don't think we do)

If you zoom in on the health bar, you can see very subtle dots used to create a halftone effect.
