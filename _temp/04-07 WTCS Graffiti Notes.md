# The Use of the Graffiti

### Decal Decoration

Okay, so the graffiti in our game is primarily used to decorate the levels and break up the "sameyness" of the levels. This helps since almost every wall is the same texture.

*This is most likely what we're gonna use your graffiti for*

We have a whole bunch of empty walls in-game that we can fill with graffiti

(They said the thing!)

We'd probably put other pieces of graffiti from other games here (if we get that going)

No graffiti here. I just wanted to show off our new fog. Somebody outside the team HAS to see this!!!
### Gameplay

In other areas, we also use the graffiti to indicate that the player can wall-run on that specific surface.

- These pieces of graffiti have a special effect on them; the outlines glows and rotates slowly.
- Its important to note that any pieces of graffiti that use this effect have a solid color around the edges of the graffiti.

(Don't ask why "Diggin" is a thing)

### Lore

We also really wanna use the graffiti as a form of story-telling in the game (im ngl the story conveyance is in a rough spot rn). We wanna use our 2D artist for this, but she's kinda busy doing marketing materials rn

I'm ngl it'd be pretty funny to have Chance dying being a pivotal part of our plot.

*we don't have any screenshots for anything like this rn :(*
