# The Use of the Graffiti

### Decoration

Okay, so the graffiti in our game is primarily used to decorate the levels and break up the "sameyness" of the levels.

*This is most likely what we're gonna use your graffiti for*

### Gameplay

In other areas, we also use the graffiti to indicate that the player can wall-run on that specific surface.

- These pieces of graffiti have a special effect on them; the outlines glows and rotates slowly.
- Its important to note that any pieces of graffiti that use this effect have a solid color around the edges of the graffiti.

(Don't ask why "Diggin" is a thing)

### Lore

We also really wanna use the graffiti as a form of story-telling in the game (im ngl the story conveyance is in a rough spot rn). We wanna use our 2D artist for this, but she's kinda busy doing marketing materials rn

I'm ngl it'd be pretty funny to have Chance dying being a pivotal part of our plot.

*we don't have any screenshots for anything like this rn :(*
